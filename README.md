# Jellyfin Email Digest

Sends scheduled multilingual email digests of newly added media to each Jellyfin
user, filtered strictly by what that user is authorized to see in Jellyfin.

Replaces a standalone notifier (Docker container + JSON user mappings + cron/systemd
timer + separate web UI) with a native Jellyfin plugin.

**Status: Phase 1 (discovery and skeleton) only.** No SMTP, no media querying, no user
preferences, no digest logic yet.

## Compatibility

- Target server: **Jellyfin 10.11.x**, developed and pinned against **10.11.8**.
- Target framework: **net9.0** (matches Jellyfin 10.11.8's own `global.json`, which
  pins .NET SDK `9.0.0`).
- `Jellyfin.Controller` / `Jellyfin.Model` NuGet packages are pinned to the exact
  server version, `10.11.8`. Per Jellyfin's plugin guidance, a mismatch between the
  package version and the running server's version causes the dashboard to report the
  plugin as `NotSupported`. When moving to a newer 10.11.x patch, bump this
  deliberately and re-verify against a live server before shipping.
- **Jellyfin 12 is explicitly out of scope for this plugin at this stage.**

## Plugin identity

- Name: `Email Digest`
- GUID: `0e2dad96-d957-4026-8abb-0ca78068c5f0`
- Assembly: `Jellyfin.Plugin.EmailDigest.dll`

## Building

```shell
dotnet restore
dotnet build --configuration Release
```

Requires .NET SDK 9.0.x (see `global.json`).

## Manual install on a Jellyfin 10.11.8 server

1. Build in Release configuration (above).
2. Create a folder named `Email Digest_0.1.0.0` (or similar) under the server's
   plugins directory (e.g. `/var/lib/jellyfin/plugins` on Linux, or
   `%ProgramData%\Jellyfin\Server\plugins` on Windows).
3. Copy `Jellyfin.Plugin.EmailDigest.dll` (and `.pdb` if you want debug symbols) from
   `Jellyfin.Plugin.EmailDigest/bin/Release/net9.0/` into that folder.
4. Restart the Jellyfin server.
5. In Dashboard → Plugins, confirm "Email Digest" appears and is **not** marked
   `NotSupported`.
6. Open the plugin's configuration page from the dashboard — it should load the
   Phase 1 placeholder page.
7. In Dashboard → Scheduled Tasks, confirm a task named "Send Email Digest" appears
   under the "Email Digest" category, and can be run manually (it currently logs one
   line and completes immediately; it sends no email and touches no media).

This has not yet been verified against a live 10.11.8 server as part of this pass —
see the Phase 1 report for what was and wasn't verified.
